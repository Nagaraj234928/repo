            I am extremely happy to see Our school as a glorious blossomed Flower.</h4>
            
           <P> Managing TrusteeEducation from Kg to post Doctoral level has been provided to children for the last 31 years by SNR sons Charitable trust and it is not the only priority. We believe that children should be able to handle any situation better in their life later. I have seen a lot of positive improvements in students. The introduction of Samacheer syllabus by Government of Tamil Nadu and other allied co-scholastic subjects and activities were very well received by our children and they excelled in all their scholastic and non-scholastic activities. Student - friendly teachers share a healthy relation with children and a little more support from parents authorizing the teacher in disciplining children would do wonders.
            
            Hence co-operation and understanding the situation by parents would help to have a cordial relationship with teachers who in turn could not only complete the syllabus and but also the concept based lessons / exercises. This would create a balance between studies and extracurricular activities. Allow the child to be inquisitive give them their childhood. Allow them to take part in all intra and inter school competitions to be more skillful. And this is the need of the hour.</P>

       <h2> About </h2>
SRKMHSS was Established in 1978 with modest infrastructure and a handful of 15 students. However, there were 3 outstanding features which distinguished this school from all other institutions in the Vellore district.

Active involvement of parents, school, and community – the three catalysts of change. Incorporation of the philosophy of holistic education (which can be explained in terms of good teachers, overall development of children, rich infrastructure and other elements). A notable emphasis on the moral education of children. These were sure to pay dividends! Today SRKMHSS has the strength of nearly 3,000 students and a teaching fraternity of 130 well-trained & qualified teachers.
